# E-commerce-Data-Analysis-using-Olist-Dataset-
Example of how to report insights to non- technical background stakeholders of a company.
For this project i have taken the popular E-commerce dataset from kaggle (Olist Braziilian Ecommerce company) and used it by creating some important hypotetical questions which are useful for the top-mangment for knwoing the current situation of the comapany.
As this is just about Explanatory Data Analysis. I have not included any predictaive modelling. 

# Correlation Analysis
For this analysis I have used only the few important features which can provide a better insight for the decision makers regarding opertations, logistics, ITC and other arears.
Correlation analysis suggest a high negative correlation between review score and delivery days suggesting that as delivery gets delayed (increase in number of delivery days) review score decresases. Approval time and payment value also have impact on reviews.
